		areas and during the summer months. Cities such as Milan depend on 80 percent of water from Alpine runoff.
		Water from the rivers is used in over 500 hydroelectricity power plants, generating as much as 2900 kilowatts of electricity.</blockquote></p>

		<label>Machu Picchu,Peru</label>
		<p><blockquote> The central buildings of Machu Picchu use the classical Inca architectural style of polished dry-stone walls of regular shape. 
		The Incas were masters of this technique, called ashlar, in which blocks of stone are cut to fit together tightly without mortar.
		Many junctions in the central city are so perfect that it is said not even a blade of grass fits between the stones. The section of the mountain 
		which Machu Picchu was built on provided several beneficial and detrimental factors. The most apparent detriment was that Machu Picchu was built 
		between two fault lines. This location also frequently received heavy rainfall; this meant that land and mud slides in the area were also common.
		The Inca needed a solution to these detriments, and Machu Picchu would offer everything they needed. The seismic activity which is caused by being 
		between two fault lines led the use of mortar and other such building materials to be nearly useless.</blockquote></p>
